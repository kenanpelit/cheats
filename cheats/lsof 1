List programs that have deleted files opened and may need to be restarted
sudo lsof -n +c 0 | grep DEL | grep -vF $'/dev/\n/SYSV\n/run/' | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort -u | sed 's/\\x20/ /g'
# lsof: list programs with open files
#   -n: don’t look up host names for sockets or other network connections
#   +c 0: don’t truncate process names
# grep DEL: select files that lsof has marked DELeted
# grep -vF …: strip out some common uninteresting files: /dev/zero, /dev/shm/…, /SYSV…, /run/…
# cut -d' ' -f1: select the first space-separated field (process name)
# sort -u: don’t show repeated names several times
# sed …: unescape spaces
#
# This shows files that were opened by a process and then deleted or replaced.
# This can indicate that a library that a process uses was updated (file was replaced),
# and that the process should be restarted to use the new version of the library.
# (Note: on a desktop system, you can get lots of garbage –
# dconf, glib schemas and fontconfig are common culprits.
# This is more useful on a server.)
